            <h2> Lake Naivasha </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                <b>Lake Naivasha</b> is a large lake to the northwest of Nairobi. It is a part of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya. This freshwater lake is located at the highest point in the Great Rift Valley at 1884m. The forest surrounding the lake is home to over 400 bird species. So, it is making it the perfect destination for birdies from all corners of the world. It is the main bread and butter of Naivasha and other small towns of the regions. Tourists can find a lot of activities while their stay in Naivasha. The activities like Hell’s gate Safari, Visit Crescent Island, and Hike to Mount Longonot are the other bonuses that you can get while visiting Lake Naivasha.
            </p>
            <h2> How to Get to Naivasha </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                <b>Lake Naivasha</b> is easily accessible via flight and road. Travelling to Lake Naivasha depends on which route you choose to travel from. <b>Via Air</b>: The closest international airport is the Nairobi Airport or the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport through which most visitors come to Lake Naivasha. Some of the airlines that operate here are Kenya Airways, Egypt Air, Emirates, Air Arabia, Lufthansa, KLM, South African Airways and many others. Naivasha is located about 2-hours away from Nairobi. The fastest way to get to Naivasha is through private means. Visiting Naivasha is the perfect excuse to go on a road trip. You can either use the Old Naivasha route from Nairobi, which passes by Maai Mahiu or the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway. If using public means, board a matatu from Accra Road in Nairobi CBD, fares start from Kshs.400 per person. Alternatively, you can take the SGR passenger train to Suswa and connect to Naivasha through public means. I’d highly recommend the former options though.

          <h2>Best Time to Visit Lake Naivasha</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            You can explore the best of <b>Lake Naivasha</b> throughout the year with it pleasing climatic condition. Talking about the best time to visit Lake Naivasha, the months from June to October are considered as the best time to travel around, exploring the wildlife and the scenic beauty. These are the summer season with hot days but bearable situation for a safari.  The winters are even considered ideal for the tour of Lake Naivasha as the climate is cold and pleasing. However, there may be a little rain but overall the temperature is ideal for an excursion to Lake Naivasha.
          </p>
          <h2>Hells Gate National Park</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Hell’s Gate National Park is staggeringly beautiful. The Lion King based their interpretation of Africa on this park, its towering crags, deep riverine canyons, acres of savannah, obsidian caves, hot springs and volcanic activities make this small park a hit with photographers and nature enthusiasts. It’s one of the few parks in Kenya where you can cycle or walk freely. Hell’s Gate National Park has no elephant, lion or leopard, so hire a bike at the gate and spend your day meandering through the scenery. Hell’s Gate has a fabulously scenic canyon through which you can hike. Used as a location for many films (see it in Tomb Raider) the walls have been carved by water over millennia and twist and turn deep through the rock. The hike can be done without a guide, but it is better to pay the local Maasai to walk you through. Do not enter the canyon if it has rained recently, as people have died in flash floods.
          </p>
          <h2>Sanctuary Farm</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Sanctuary Farm is now somewhat smaller than it used to be thanks to the rising lake, but it still commands over 400 acres of wildlife conservancy. <b>Sanctuary Farm</b> is an excellent place to ride horses in Naivasha. Horse riding at Sanctuary Farm allows you to ride alongside zebra, giraffe, impala, gazelle, waterbuck and other animals. The wildlife is less afraid of the horses, so you can get close to them without scaring them off. If you aren’t keen on riding, then you can hire bikes, go on a guided walk, or even take a nighttime game drive in one of the open-top safari vehicles.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2>Lake Naivasha Boat Ride </h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                You are here to spend time with <b>Lake Naivasha</b>, so Boating in its freshwater must be your top-end activity. You can take a boat ride for 6500KES ($35) per boat that can hold up to 7 persons. So, if you can make a group of seven, the cost will be much reduced to 500KES. The Boating time will be from one hour to two hours. You can see a different perspective of the town from the lakeside and spot the flora and fauna of the Great Rift Valley. You can spot many groups of Hippos while boating near to them. Furthermore, you can go to Crescent Island by boat too. Lake Naivasha is a beautiful lake full of birds and hippos. A Lake Naivasha boat trip is highly recommended. You will most likely spot hippos, herons, pelicans and dozens of other birds. With a little luck, you can even see a lost flamingo. These animals used to be found in Lake Naivasha, but due to the rise in water levels, they have been migrated to neighboring lakes such as Lake Nakuru and <b>Lake Baringo</b>.
            </p>
            <h2>A day Visit to Crescent Island</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Crescent Island is a small private island in<b> Lake Naivasha</b>. It is a peninsula and it is among the cool things to visit this island. Again, here you can find many wild animals like Zebras, Giraffes, and Impalas. It is also one of those places in Kenya where you can walk through between Zebras, Giraffes, and other animals. The island is also ideal for activities such as hiking, biking, walking, and weekend retreats. However, at present, it is accessible only from Waterside. It has an entry fee of 60$
            </p>
            <h2>Spotting Wild Animals</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This is the activity for which you come to <b>Lake Naivasha</b>. Imagine you were sitting beside your Lake Naivasha Hotel and spotted bloat of hippos. Most of the campsites leave a place beside the lake for hippos. So, it is common sightseeing of hippos, especially in the evening. Alternatively, you can spot different species of Monkeys. Especially the black and white Colobus are jumping around from tree to tree. Moreover, you can spot Zebras, Giraffes, Warthogs, Impalas, and wild Buffalos at Hell’s gate and at Crescent Island.

It is located further ahead of Lake Nakuru. Furthermore, you can combine Lake Naivasha with the Masai Mara Safari option too.
